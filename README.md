# Moody: Your Vibe Partner

Moody can be your favourite vibing partner while you work your brains out coding the next big thing!

Be it a frustrating session filled with debugging and finding even more errors, or a one shot hit at your desired results, 
Moody has got you covered :)  

Moody is a simple webview based extension that checks how many errors are present on the file that the user is currently working on, 
and then chooses an appropriate mood from its diverse collection that the user might relate with.

After all, who doesn't like a cute little programming buddy to code with ;) ?

## Features

* Moody can be a relatable friend of the user in any situation!

* Below clip just shows how well Moody can keep the mood light and fun while programming :)
